# Hello

How are you.

Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.

This is a link, that should be linkified www.google.de

| H1                        | H2  | H3  |
| ------------------------- | --- | --- |
| This cell spans 3 columns |     |     |

Another table:

| H1            | H2     |
| ------------- | ------ |
| This cell     | Cell A |
| spans three ^ | Cell B |
| rows ^        | Cell C |

And another table:

| This header spans two || Header A |
| columns _and_ two rows ^|| Header B |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Cell A | Cell B | Cell C |

This is some code:

```ts
const method = async () => {
  return Promise.resolve(5);
};
```
